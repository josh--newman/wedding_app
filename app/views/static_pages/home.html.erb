<p>In the mean time, why not look at some accommodation? The date is in the school holidays so places are booking fast. Casuarina itself has some accomodation and Kingscliffe is approximately a 5 minute drive. Coolangatta is approximately a 20 minute drive. Some have already booked at <a href="http://cottonbeachresort.com.au/" target="_blank">Cotton Beach Resort</a>. You can also find accomodation by searching on <a href="http://www.stayz.com.au/" target="_blank">Stayz</a></p>
